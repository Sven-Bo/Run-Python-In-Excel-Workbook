Enhance your Excel capabilities by harnessing the power of Python through this xlwings tutorial. Here, I will demonstrate how to execute Python scripts within an open Excel workbook.

With xlwings, you can tap into Python's extensive scientific libraries (such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, and more) to create powerful tools, replacing the need for VBA. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with practical examples that showcase how to plot and update stock market data, interact with APIs to retrieve results for Excel, and even generate a PDF stock report.
